#ifndef ThermalEfficiency_h

/// This subroutine is used to calculate the thermal efficiency of a heat engine extracting heat from a hot thermal reservoir and dumping heat into a cold thermal reservoir. It also contains the calculations comparing the given process to its equivalent carnot cycle to determine whether or not the proposed is in violation of the quality argument of the second law of thermodynamics.
